# Organization for Children

## About
This project is a model of a fictional organization aimed at helping children in need. While it is not a real organization, it showcases ideas for fundraising, donations, and medical missions to support underprivileged children. This project serves as an example of how such initiatives can positively impact children's lives and help create a better future for them.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a template for understanding how an organization could work to improve the lives of children in need. It is designed to demonstrate that small actions can make a huge difference, and to inspire others to take similar steps in real-life causes.

## Features
- **Fundraising**: A simulated process for raising funds to support various initiatives for children in need.
- **Donations**: A demonstration of how donations can be received and managed.
